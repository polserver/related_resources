Version 1.3a-
   Fixed bug that allowed the door to "wander" if it was clicked on too many times
   in rapid succession.

Version 1.3 update- 
   1) Moved the checks for keys into the include file, so they are accessible
   to other scripts that might want to be able to access the doors.
   2) Moved a lot of the functionality into open_door() rather than the doors.ecl-
   the sleep and then close the door bit is now in open_door, so if that gets called
   (say, by an AI) the door will close behind it.
   3) Doors will no longer close if someone is in the tile the door will close into. 
   Note that doors will still _open_ into mobs, for now.
   4) open_door is now its own function, rather than an include. Thus it can easily be called by
   other scripts, such as AIs or dot commands.
   5) Added a config file. There are three options therein, one to designate whether or not
   opening a door refreshes a house,  one to designate whether or not some doors (most often
   those in multis) have an "inside" from which you do not need a key, and one to designate
   whether or not you can close an open but locked door. Settings for this are
   described inside the config file.

Version 1.2-
Thanks to Syzygy, for the original doors pkg.
Thanks to Zulu, I used his changes code as a reference.
And thanks to Dundee, for many many helpful comments on the scripting list, and
for the unlock/open/relock code.
Unless Syzygy objects, I'll take over maintaining this code-
  he's got plenty to deal with as it is.

This package removes all the core function calls from door functionality. It
includes working wooden and metal gates. 
It adds a new doortype: stone. Stone doors make the same noise as metal ones
by default. There are no stone doors at the moment, but soon I will add dungeon
secret doors to the itemdesc and release that. 
By default any door's open graphic is its closed graphic +1. If you choose to 
make a door for which this is not the case, set its cprop opengraphic to the
decimal number of its open graphic. I added that code to the functionality
believing I might need it to get all the gates working. Turned out not to help,
but I left it in. Might use it for secret doors.

There is one gate of each type that, when opening, does not change position. I
believe that it will still prevent players from passing through it, as a solid
object still remains in that tile. These gates are:
0x0829, 0x0851, 0x0845, 0x0872. They are all east facing gates with hinges on
the left side opening counterclockwise.
