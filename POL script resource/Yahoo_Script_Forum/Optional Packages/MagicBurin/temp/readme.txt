Frobozz Magic Burin v1.0
By: Sigismund

(With apologies to Infocom)

Add your own sigils to items in-game!  Any apprentice scribe, armed with a
magic burin, can mark your world up with graffiti!  Only works on objects,
no living creatures, and you can write up to one line of text.   If
something is already written on it, any new sigils inscribed will overwrite
the existing ones.

Here's the best part- only players equipped with a magic sigil viewer can
read what is written.  So a scribe can write directions to his house on a
blank book, which are invisible unless seen with a viewer!  Thorfinn the
Fighter can autograph his kills!  Manfred the Mage can taunt lesser beings!
THE FUN NEVER STOPS!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, to write on something, just d-click the burin and select the item.
If there's something already written on it, you will replace the existing
writing.  To read something written, d-click the viewer, and select the
item.  To see if anything nearby has sigils written upon it, d-click the
viewer, then select the viewer itself.  You cannot inscribe anything on
either a burin or a viewer.
